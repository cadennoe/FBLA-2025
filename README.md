# Goal

My goal was to create a program that helps students manage their personal finances by tracking account
balances, income and expenses. The program allows users to input details about their
income sources and expenses, including the amount, category, and date of each transaction.
It provides features to view the current balance, view bar graphs of income and
expenses over the last four weeks or six months, and categorizes both incomes expenses to show
spending patterns. Additionally, the program include functionality to update or delete
existing entries and offers a search and filter option to easily find specific transactions.
